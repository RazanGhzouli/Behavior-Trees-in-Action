### What is this repository for? ###

This online Appendix is for the papers:
- Behavior Trees and State Machines in Robotics Applications (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2208.04211) currently under submission and waiting revision;
- Behavior Trees in Action: A Study of Robotics Applications (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3426425.3426942).

The same informatiom can be found in our Bitbucket repository as well (https://bitbucket.org/easelab/behaviortrees).

### How do I get set up? ###
We have structured the repo as two seperate folders each for a dataset: behavior trees dataset and state machines dataset. 

In the "raw-model-data" folder in each dataset folder, you can find the codes that include the behavior model in a project. For the statistics that are aggregated and presented in the paper, we provide an excel file for each behavior modeling languague dataset with detailed stats about each model. Finally, all the codes mentioned in our papers and used for mining projects and analysis is provided in the scripts folder.
