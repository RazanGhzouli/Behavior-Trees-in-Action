    .. graphviz:: dot/selector.dot

    A selector executes each of its child behaviours in turn until one of them
    fails (at which point it itself returns :data:`~py_trees.common.Status.RUNNING` or :data:`~py_trees.common.Status.FAILURE`,
    or it runs out of children at which point it itself returns :data:`~py_trees.common.Status.FAILURE`.
    We usually refer to selecting children as a means of *choosing between priorities*.
    Each child and its subtree represent a decreasingly lower priority path.

    .. note::

       Switching from a low -> high priority branch causes a `stop(INVALID)` signal to be sent to the previously
       executing low priority branch. This signal will percolate down that child's own subtree. Behaviours
       should make sure that they catch this and *destruct* appropriately.

    Make sure you do your appropriate cleanup in the :meth:`terminate()` methods! e.g. cancelling a running goal, or restoring a context.

    .. seealso:: The :ref:`py-trees-demo-selector-program` program demos higher priority switching under a selector.
